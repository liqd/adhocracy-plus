# adhocracy+

[adhocracy.plus](https://adhocracy.plus/) is a free Open-Source participation platform maintained and primarily developed by Liquid Democracy e.V.. It is based on [adhocracy 4](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy4) and [Django](https://github.com/django/django). The project's [technical documentation](https://liqd.github.io/adhocracy-plus/) currently is in progress. You are welcome to provide feedback by creating a GitHub issue.

## Getting started

adhocracy+ is designed to make online participation easy and accessible to everyone. It can be used on our SaaS-platform or installed on your own servers. How to get started on our platform is explained [here](https://adhocracy.plus/info/start/).

## Installation for development

### Requirements

 * nodejs (+ npm) 
 * python 3.x (+ venv + pip)
 * libpq (only if postgres should be used)
 * pillow-heif (required for macOS M1 Monterey and newer versions)
 * libpq (only if PostgreSQL is used)
 * GDAL
 * SpatiaLite [with JSON1 enabled](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension) (only if SpatiaLite is used for local development)
 * Redis (required in production, optional for development)

### Installing SpatiaLite

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libsqlite3-mod-spatialite
```

#### macOS (with Homebrew)

```
brew update
brew install spatialite-tools
brew install gdal
```

For GeoDjango to be able to find the SpatiaLite library, add the following to your local.py:

```
SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH = "/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib"
```

#### Pyenv

If you are using pyenv, you need to create your venv with the following command:

```
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions" pyenv install 3.12.9 (with your version)
```

### Adhocracy-plus software Installation

    git clone https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy-plus.git
    cd adhocracy-plus
    make install 
    make fixtures

### Start virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Check if tests work
```
make test
```
### Start a local server
```
make watch
```
Go to http://localhost:8004/ and login with admin@liqd.net | password

## Security

We take security seriously. If you find any security issues, please feel free to email us at info [at] liqd [dot] net.


## Advanced settings 

### Use postgresql database for testing

run the following command once:
```
make postgres-create
```
to start the test server with postgresql, run:
```
export DATABASE=postgresql
make postgres-start
make watch
```

### Use Celery for task queues

For a celery worker to pick up tasks you need to make sure that:
- the redis server is running. Check it by running
```
redis-cli ping 
```
it should return: PONG

- the celery config parameter "always eager" is disabled (add `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = False` to your `local.py`)
Celery's always_eager is disabled to ensure tests run the celery tasks inline instead of scheduling them via the Redis broker.
local.py should be under adhocracy_plus/config/settings, create one if it doesn't exist. This file saves settings for local development.

To start a celery worker node in the foreground, call:
```
make celery-worker-start
```

To inspect all registered tasks, list the running worker nodes, call:
```
make celery-worker-status
```

To send a dummy task to the queue and report the result, call:
```
make celery-worker-dummy-task
```
